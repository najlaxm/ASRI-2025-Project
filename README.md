# ASRI-2025-Project
A health informatics analysis investigating the relationship between geographic location and disability rates across US counties using CDC PLACES data and USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes.

Completed for the Arkansas Summer Research Institute (ASRI) Summer 2025 Program.

**Key Findings**
Statistical analysis revealed significant disparities between urban and rural counties (F = 75.37, p < 0.001), with rural communities experiencing consistently higher disability prevalence rates. This highlights critical healthcare access challenges in non-metropolitan areas.

**Technical Approach**
Merged CDC PLACES County Data with USDA classification codes
Conducted ANOVA testing across 9 county types
Performed data cleaning and exploratory analysis using Python (Pandas)
Created visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib

**Impact**
Findings support evidence-based public health policy recommendations for rural healthcare resource allocation, telehealth expansion, and targeted interventions.
Tools: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib | Methods: ANOVA, Statistical Analysis
